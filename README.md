# POSTER

A simple blog application for creating, viewing and updating stories.

The backend of this application was built from scratch without any npm package.

The web framework CobiExpress was built by me, using the http module which is built on top of the net node module for managing tcp connections. This frameworks design was inspired by express. It is not as robust and feature rich as express. the main purpose was to demonstrate practical understanding of core node js concepts and backend knowledge in general.
